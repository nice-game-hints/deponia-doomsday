There is a potato in the Village Center.

# But it's hot!
Maybe you could cool it down a little?

# With what?
Something cold? Like [ice](051-ice.md).

# I have ice
Cool, maybe you can now cool the potato.

# No (d)ice!
Maybe the ice cubes are wrong _form_ here.

# You mean?
Yes, melt them to fresh cooling water.

# How?
There are those hot barbecue bins all around. Put the glass (with ice) on the bin.

# It won't melt
What's with the lights? Somebody turns them off everywhere you go!

# I know
Walk towards the alley to get the barbecue bin on again. The ice will melt.

# Water!
Pour the water on the potato. It is now cooled down.

# Potato
If you need just the potato click it in the inventory to remove the tin foil.
