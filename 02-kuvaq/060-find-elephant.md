So, [you asked Toni to come with you](020-toni-first.md) but that damned elephant has now broken the glass.

# Why?
Well, don't ask me! Or, actually, these are the tips. So, go ahead.
Go to the balloon house and inspect the shards.

# Inspecting...
Take the shard of glass and click on the glowing place. Take the elephant skin.

# Now what?
With the shard of glass you can find out the elephant traces. Just follow them until you find something interesting.

# Care to guide me?
Okay...
 - First, follow the traces to the junction
 - Next, get back from the junction to the balloon (it was a dead end)
 - Now the tracks lead to the Burnert's cabin from the shards
 - At the cabin the tracks lead up to the heap
 - Follow the tracks over the heap and back to the path
 - Now the tracks lead to the junction, againo
 - At the junction the tracks seem to end right of the Kuvaq entrance
 - They will continue on the farer heap junk (right of the lamp post)
 - Follow the tracks until you can click the lever on the cactus

# Levered
You found the hideout.
