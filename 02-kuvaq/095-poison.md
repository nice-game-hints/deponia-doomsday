(You should have [got Toni out of Lonzo's, first.](020-toni-first.md))

The bees are at the wax drawer in the honey dispenser.

# They attack me
You need something to attract them. Something that looks like a hive.

# Like?
[A beard maybe?](085-rat-man.md) Open the drawer when Rat Man is present.

# The bees
They are in the beard, yes. You should, umm... maybe.. shave his beard?

# Shave?
Well, you would need [a shaver](097-shaver.md).

# I have the shaver
Shave him! Shave the Rat Man. Shave him good.

# Shaved
You should now have the bees. Maybe someone else will do the poison thing...
