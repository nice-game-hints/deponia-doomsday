You know, the Nilbot (next to Burnert's Cabin) also works as a Chillbot.

# (N)ice!
Ice indeed. You just need, you guessed it, [a power inverter!](045-power-inverter.md)

# I have the power inverter
Go to the Nilbot.
Put the glass (you get it from Lonzo's table) in the dispenser.
Insert the Power Inverter and it turns into a Chillbot!
You get the ice to the glass from the button.

# Killbot!
Right! You should now have [got Toni out of Lonzo's.](020-toni-first.md) Don't read further until you have done that!

# I have done it
Ok, the second time you are getting the ice Chillbot is a Killbot! You need to throttle!

# Throttle?
Really? Insert the throttle limiter to the right compartment. Activating the Chillbot is a skippable minigame.
Take the ice into the glass as before.
