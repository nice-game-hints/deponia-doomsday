You know, the Nilbot (next to Burnert's Cabin) also works as a Chillbot.

# (N)ice!
Ice indeed. You just need, you guessed it, [a power inverter!](045-power-inverter.md)

# I have the power inverter
Go to the Nilbot and insert the Power Inverter. It turns into a Chillbot!

# Chill
Put the glass (you get it from Lonzo's table) in the dispenser and push the button.
