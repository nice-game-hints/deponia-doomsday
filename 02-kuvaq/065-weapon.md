You have to [get Toni out of Lonzo's first](020-toni-first.md).

Zoon has a nice elephant gun there. But he only gives it to a big game hunter.

# I need a license
Did you talk to Wenzel?

# Yes
He has a hunting license as a prize from the Rotting Fruit game. [Play the game](080-rotten-fruit.md)

# Oh rats!
Give the rat to Zoon, he'll accept it. Grab the gun!
