Muck does not want to be alone guarding you two. He wants a gun for his safety.

# Gun
Indeed. [Zoon owns a gun.](065-weapon.md) Give the gun to Tuck.

# It's not...
Isn't he a sissy. Well, you know what to use: Gunpowder!

# Where?
Hmm.. who sells rockets?

# I know
Go to Burnert's and grab one of the rockets.

# Rocketing!
Use the shard of glass to get the gunpowder out and put the gunpowder into the gun.
Maybe this will ease Tuck.

# No...
Isn't he something. You should use some small stuff as an ammo.

# What?
Use the small junk you got from one of the balloon bags as an ammo.
How about now?

# No, I need to do everything myself
You could stuff the ammo into the barrel with something like... [a bottle brush](067-bottle-brush.md)?
