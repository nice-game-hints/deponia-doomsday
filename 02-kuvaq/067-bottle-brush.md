The band bottle player is using his bottle brush to clean the bottle.

# How do I get it?
They stop playing everytime you are near. They say they need light for the song. The song they know by heart (their hit!) is something Zoon doesn't want to hear.

# I would like to hear it
I bet you would. Maybe you could muffle the sound from Zoon.

# How?
Create an impromptu mufflers, you potato-ears!
