The band bottle player is using his bottle brush to clean the bottle when they are not playing.

# How do I get it?
They stop playing everytime you are near. They say they need light for the song. The song they know by heart (their hit!) is something Zoon doesn't want to hear.

# I would like to hear it
[It can be arranged.](069-band.md)

# Ru-di, Ru-di!
Come on! It's not that good of a song. Grab the bottle brush.
