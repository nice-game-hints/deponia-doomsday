(You should have [got Toni out of Lonzo's, first.](020-toni-first.md))

Building a blowgun is easy. Just ask Zoon.

# So...
You need:
 - A straw (from Lonzo's)
 - A dart (from Lonzo's, also)
 - [And some bee poison](095-poison.md)

# I have all of them
Give them all to Zoon. He build the pipe for you (isn't that nice).
