You would really like to hear their hit Rudi's Dental Work.
That is the only song they can play by heart as the lights are out.

# I would, yes
But Zoon hates it. Maybe you could muffle the sound from Zoon.

# How?
Create an impromptu mufflers, you potato-ears!

# Potato, you say?
Urm, yes. Get [a potato](050-potato.md)

# I have a potato
Now, halve it. There is a potato-halving machine at the village center. Handy!

# Halved potatoes
Yes yes. Attach them to the bra underwire.

# Ear protectors!
Give them to Zoon.
