McChromium does not let you to Burnter before the elephant trap is ready.

# Let's get trapping
Okay. Hmm.. where to start. Did you visit the china shop already?

# I did
And you got [the toilet seat](110-toilet-seat.md)?

# Yes
Good. Good... Next, did you try the lever downstairs?

# Yes, I know how the lever works
Fine. Fine... Do you see the idea here?

# No?
The rope can't be _guided_ just with the sign post. Guide it with something else.

# The seat?
Yes. Attach it to the sign bracket. Get rid of the signs first. (The signs should be in down position, naturally.)

# How?
Use the wrench (at your balloon room's table) to the signs. Attach the toilet seat to the bracket.

# Fancy
Well, whatever you like. Now, lift the toilet seat up with the crank downstairs.

# It is up
Throw the rope through it.

# Final trap
Get the noose and set it on the hatch. The trap is set. Go get Toni!
