There is an elysian stuck under the debris.

# How to get him free?
You know, lift the pipe that is holding him.

# But how?
Let's think this through. Why not have [some ice cream in the meantime](050-icecream.md)?

# Hook!
Yup, after removing the debris the hook is now usable.

# What to do with it
Isn't it clear? Push ice cream order button to lower it first and then attach the hook to the pipe.

# Ungh
Well, it was a good shot. Now the reel is on the floor.

# What to do with it?
Well, the window box is just the right size. Just put the reel into the window box for time being.

# Shaky!
The floor is sloppy, yes. Maybe you could yank the balcony off and thus lift the pipe.

# Yank?
Use the pole in the gap. Break off the railings. Just click it multiple times to finish the job.
