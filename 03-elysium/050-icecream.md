The machine doesn't work until you [get the electricity back](025-electricity.md).

# It's on
The ice cream machine is cool. But all the ice cream is goo.

# Yuck
They've run out of fire extinguishers. [Get them one.](055-fire-extinguisher.md)

# I have the extinguisher
Probably, yes. Put the fire extinguisher into the ice cream elevator. Order some ice cream (from the button right, yes).

# Oops
Remove the debris from the broken elevator and you get a nice hook to use.
