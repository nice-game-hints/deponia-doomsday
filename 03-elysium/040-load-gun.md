Nice paintball gun. It needs ammunition. Does Ronny the flower have some hints about it?

# He didn't
But he said that the workers are stuck somewhere.

# So?
Maybe you could reach them with some other machine.

# Like?
Like the [ice cream machine](050-icecream.md).

# Hmmm...
Well, maybe the balloon idea wasn't that good after all. You don't need paintball ammunition anymore.

# But the gun?
Okay okay. The paintball gun is just a red herring. You don't need it, at all!
