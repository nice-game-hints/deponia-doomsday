After opening the garage door with the crowbar you can find the potential portal with your 4D glasses.

# But my tachyon ammunition!
Oh yeah. The water has removed the tachyon from your clock hands. Where to get more, here?

# Where?
Do you remember which machine got tachyon, also. Hint, check your inventory.

# Oh!
Yup, there's the old butter churner. Click the time machine key and open the hood. Use the crossbow on the motor. You can now activate the portal.
