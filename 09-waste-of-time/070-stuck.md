Are you having a situation that there are no places to go? No worries, this guide will help you!

# Thank you!
Do you know what this world needs more?

# No, what?
Portals! More portals. Always try to find more hidden portals.

# Hidden portals?
Try on the 4D glasses. [You get them from the lab.](030-paradox-city/030-lab/010-first.md) The glasses will show you the potential portals in the place you are at the moment.

# I found one
Now, just activate the portal with your tachyon crossbow.
