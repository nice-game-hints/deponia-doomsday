Potential portals are small _pre portals_. When you arrive to the Waste of Time you can enable one potential portal by clicking the timepod.

# How do I activate them?
They are out of reach usually. Maybe you could shoot them with someting.

# Shoot?
There is a crossbow next to Momed at Waste of Time.

# What about the ammunition?
They are _time_ portals. So, of course you use the clock hands. Combine the clock hands with the crossbow.

# It doesn't activate!
Haven't you already learned that the essential substance for time travel is tachyon?

# Tachyon?
There is a tachyon slime puddle under the timepod. Use the loaded crowssbow in the puddle. Then shoot the potential portal.
