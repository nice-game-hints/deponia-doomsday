You yourself can't get fully into the lab. But you can still do stuff there.

# What?
Did you search yourself, already?

# Yes
Okay, so you got the handy 4D glasses from your pocket. Those will come handy later... or earlier... or in the future.

# I have them

# What?
[The tin of beans.](015-beans.md)
