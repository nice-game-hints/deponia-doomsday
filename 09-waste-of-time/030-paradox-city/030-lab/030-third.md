You are in the lab, again. For the third time. This time both the portals are gone and no one is frozen.

# How do I get away?
I think you remember how you did it the very first time?

# Remind me
Put on your 4D glasses to find the potential portal.

# Portals
Then, activate them. Use the crossbow or the pump.
