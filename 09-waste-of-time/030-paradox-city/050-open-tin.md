You have the can. Maybe pop it open?

# How?
You would need an imprompt can opener.

# What is that?
Something that goes around and around and has a sharp object to open the can lid.

# Hmmm?
There was a jukebox next to Rita. [Fix it, first.](060-jukebox.md)

# It is fixed
Now, put the tin can into the jukebox to pry it open. You got a bean!
