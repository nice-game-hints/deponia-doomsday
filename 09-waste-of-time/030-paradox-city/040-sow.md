There is the planting bed next to the hacienda. You clearly should grow something there.

# But what?
Beans! The small portal gets you to the lab. [Grab the beans.](030-lab/015-beans.md)

# I have the tin can
Now, [open it](050-open-tin.md).

# Bean
Isn't it quite obvious you have to sow the bean, then?

# Waiting...
Disappointing. You don't have the time to wait for the bean to grow. If you just would've sowed the bean years ago.

# Years ago?
Remember where one of the students ended up? As a hillbilly living in the hacienda.

# So?
He is just falling through the portal in the lab floor. He will end up in the sowing bed and take control of the hacienda.

# Enough hinting!
Okay okay. Go through the small portal and throw the bean into the portal (frozen strudel).

# Some sowing material...
Behold, there's the beanstalk!

# Where does it lead?
[Nowhere?](070-stuck.md)
