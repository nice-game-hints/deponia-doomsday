Did you look into the gumball machine?

# There is a ring in there!
Great. Now, [get some change](065-change.md) and get the ring from the gumball machine. I think you have a good change of getting it.

# It, it...
That stupid wombat! Go beat it!

# It's tough
You need more audience to man up!

# Audience, you say?
There's the bunch of junk knights. Maybe they are up for a job. Go talk to them.

# They aren't
They are waiting for the prophet to finish on his task, first. [Help him to finish.](090-prophet.md)

# Fourth commandment
Great. Now go and offer the job to the knights. After they are with you enter the labyrinth.

# Nice RPG
You have to fight the wombat. Hint: grab the glass shard from the floor and throw it multiple times at the wombat to kill it.
