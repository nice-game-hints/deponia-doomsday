Fortune teller is not having his vision. He needs a new crystal ball for that.

# How to start?
Maybe new hat would help him. The bowling ball polisher looks like a hat to me.

# Really?
Really, believe me. Give the bowling ball polisher to the fortune teller.

# He doesn't accept it
He is not following the latest hat trends, clearly. [He should get rid of the turbane, first.](027-turbane.md)
After he is bald, give the new polisher hat to him.

# It's too extravagant
He is not following the older hat trends, clearly.

# Older hat trends?
There was someone else who is interested in (conical) hats.

# Who?
One of the junk knights reads an issue of Hats.

# He does
Go show the reading junk knight the latest issue of Hats (the blue covers). He gives you his 10 year old issue of hats.

# Old hat issue
The extravagant hats were hip back then.

# Extravagant?
You got it! Now, show the white issue of Hats to fortune teller and then give him the polisher.

# Polishing
But he still needs a ball where you can see your reflection. That ball-head!

# Ball-head you say?
I said. What about it?

# His head is kind of a ball
Go on? It is being polished at the moment.

# Hats off!
Good! Show him the blue covered Hats magazine again. He will remove the polisher from his ball... err.. head.

# On to the visioning!
He does not want to have a vision for you unless you have some [photo of your girlfriend with you](025-mock-goal.md).
After you have at least one photo with you and you talk to him he gets into visions. You can show the photo to him again to make him vision.
