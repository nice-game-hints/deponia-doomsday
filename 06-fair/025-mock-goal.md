Goal is not fancying you at the moment. Maybe you could fake that she is with you.

# Fake Goal?
Well, you have done worse. What would make a perfect fake human?

# The bowling ball?
Of course, good idea! It looks a little bit of face, doesn't it? You can find one from the fair entrance. Try stick it into the small hole.

# It is a little dull
It is. You should add eyes and a mouth to it. I wonder, what three items would fit perfectly on those holes...

# Gum?
Great idea! Go [get the chewing gums](067-gum.md) from the gumball machine (next to roller coaster). Insert them into the bowling ball.

# It is still a little dull
Yeah, yeah. Maybe some makeup would help. Get the watercolors from the roller coaster and paint the ball and the gum better.

# Beautiful
You could now try it to the smaller hole.

# It is too bald
Yes, even though they say that baldness is now the cool thing.

# They do?
Yep, in the Hats magazine. You can find the magazine from the dumpster next to the love tunnel. Talk first to the pimp and Goal.

# Well, if that's what they say
But Goal can't be bald. She has hair. Someone other is afraid to go bald. Maybe he needs encouragement.

# Who?
The fortune teller is bald. You know that. Show him the Hats magazine and he gives up his turbane.

# Bald he is
Now, put the turbane on the fake Goal bowling ball. Isn't she beautiful?

# She is
Now she fits into the smaller hole and you can take a picture of you two. [Did you activate the camera?](050-activate-camera.md)
