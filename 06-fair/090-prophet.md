The prophet is having a creative crisis. And he would need to write the fourth commandment.

# Help
[Inspire him.](095-inspire-prophet.md)

# He is inspired
Now he just needs to write down the last commandment without breaking the third "Thou shall not carve anything on stone".

# How?
Give him the watercolors. The junk knights are clearly impressed by this new commandment.
