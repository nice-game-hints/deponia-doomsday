TOOLS:
 - Hammer from Prophet
 - Chisel from Prohpet
 - Bowling ball from fairground entrance
 - Bowling ball polisher from fairground entrance
 - Camera from fairground entrance
 - Hand from fairground entrance
 - Throttle limiter from fair main square (hatch under the claw machine)
 - Sausage Token from the pimp at Tunnel of Love
 - Hats Magazine from the Tunnel of Love dumpster. But only after talking to the Pimp
 - Gingerbread heart from the roller coaster (Did I have to look at it to change it to "I Love Lou" ???)
 - Paint set from the roller coaster
 - Fuse from Sausage bot (main square)


Need to find McChronicle and a boat to Porta Fisco.


Quarry:

War heroes are having a war trauma
Prophet is looking for inspiration

Chiseller's block. Stuck on the fourth and three-quarters commandment
He carves (after talking) that never carve anything on stone. He needs some kind of inspiration etc.

Fairground Entrance:
Fortune teller needs a new crystal ball (bowling ball does not fit, at least yet).

The auto-shooter can be activated with the Throttle Limiter from the main square. Still, it takes picture of only Rufus, not good. Needs Goal, too.

Fair Main Square:
High striker does not strike high enough, but the parabells will jump up.

The claw machine does not work properly, it hits the ceiling. Taking the throttle limiter away and changing it to fuse will help. Now the crane moves right, over the ducks.

Move the claw machine left and drop it down. Then hit the High striker and the claw will catch the parabells. Move the claw right and drop it in the booth. Then, when it is elecrified, drop it in the duck pond. Magnetic fishing rod is found.

Rubber ducks are all blanks. Picking enough ducks or looking at it gives a hint: Fishing rod.

Sausage-bot is not working. You need the sausage token from the pimp to activate it. Ask the sausage bot to take one more look. It turns around revealing a hatch. Grab the fuse.

Fair Tunnel of Love:
Here you could get a boat to sail to Porta Fisco.
The ride needs a photo of lovers. Is this too easy?
Three prerequisite tasks?

Talk with Goal: Need to cheat the love machine? She says better take a picture with the other Goal? Should I device a fake Goal? Yup, talking to Goal reveals that's what we need to do.

Hall of Mirrors:
Can't find the entrance.

Roller coaster:
McChronicle is there going around and around

There's a key in the bottom of the drain

The roller coaster operator has died and the door is licked up. I mean locked up.

Gumball machine needs change
