All the magnetic ducks are blanks. If you could lift them all up to see better.

# Lift?
There is the claw machine next to it, right? [You have to activate it first.](040-activate-claw.md)

# It is working
Well, then just move it right and grab the ducks.

# It doesn't grab
Hmm.. bummer. Could you grab something to help from _left_?

# Left..
Move the claw to left, over the high striker. Have you hit the high striker, by the way?

# It is broken
Yes, it doesn't jump quite high. It is probably everything to do with the machine, not the hitter.

# Right
But the parabells jump in the back.

# They do!
Activate the claw. It stays down a little while. While it is down take the hammer and hit the high striker. The claw should grab the parabells.

# How do they help?
Well, now you have more weight in the claw. Maybe you could go through the ceiling of the booth.

# Electrified
Yes, so it is magnetized, or something.

# Yes, I can buy that
Now, lower the electrified parabells to the duck pool. (Right and activate)

# They're all blanks!
Well, you found the fishing rod.
