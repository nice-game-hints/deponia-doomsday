The auto-shooter camera is not working. It does not have electricity. There is a hatch in it.

# What to put there?
Some kind of para-mechanical component. Like [a fuse](035-fuse.md)?

# It works!
Did you try to take your picture (just click the auto shooter).

# Too fast
Yup, it is too fast. Maybe the fuse wasn't correct component here. Did you check the hatch on the claw machine?

# There it is!
The claw machine is not working fully as it is limited. The throttle limiter would suit perfectly to the camera. Insert the claw machine's throttle limiter into the camera socket. Try to take a picture.
