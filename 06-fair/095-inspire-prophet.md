The prophet is having a creative crisis with his last commandment.

# Creative crisis?
You could say _visionary_ crisis.

# Don't get it
You could show an inspiring photo to him. You can get the camera from the entrance.

# What should I photo?
The question is "who". Maybe other teller of futures?

# The fortune teller!
Yes, go and try to photograph him.

# He needs to have a vision
[Well, you can arrange that](130-vision.md)

# He is visioning
Quick, grab a photo of him.

# I got it!
Nice, a photo of a vision. The prophet will surely appreciate it. Show the photo to him. He will give you his chisel and the hammer.
