McChromicle is having a roller coaster drive. I think he has gone too many rounds already.

# Me too
[Stop the roller coaster, first.](070-rollercoaster.md)

# It is stopped
You can now visit him on the tracks.

# He is hanging in there
He doesn't want to let go. You need a tool.

# What tool?
The hammer and the chisel. [From the prophet.](090-prophet.md)

# I have the chisel and the hammer
Climb up to the roller coaster and use the hammer and the chisel on McChromicle. He is free!
