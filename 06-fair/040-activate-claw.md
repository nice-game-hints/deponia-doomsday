The claw machine almost works. It is like something is limiting its movement.

# What?
Open the hatch at the bottom.

# Para-mechanical...
It is a throttle _limiter_. Maybe some other para-mechanical component would fit better.

# Like?
Like [a fuse](035-fuse.md).

# I have the fuse
Well, insert it into claw machine's socket. Now you can move the claw left and right.
