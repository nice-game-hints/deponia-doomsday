Fuse is a really handy item. It can activate machinery and all that stuff.

# Where to find one?
Did you already [activate the sausage bot](030-sausage-bot.md), by any change?

# Well, yes I did
Did you talk to it?

# As a matter of fact, I did
And so you asked it "look one more time".

# Exactly
Can't you see the hatch in his bottom that is staring right at you?

# Well, I can indeed
Do you really need more hints? Did you open the hatch?

# I did, and it is open
Well there is the fuse! Take it! Why we had to go this far with this?
