McChromicle is stuck on a roller coaster drive. And the operator has... seen his better days, let's say it like that. The door is licked.

# Where's the key?
Did you check the drain? [Grab the key](075-key.md) and open the door with the key.

# I'm in
Brake the train. It is now stopped, almost perfectly.
