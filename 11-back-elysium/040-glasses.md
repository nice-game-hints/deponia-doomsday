This time you are building the 4D glasses in Elysium. If you are building them at Porta Fisco, [click here to get that guide](../07-porta-fisco/100-4d-glasses.md)

# How to build them
You need three items:
 - Shards of glass (just break the vase)
 - [Eyeglasses](030-babygoal/060-glasses.md)
 - [Denture glue](030-babygoal/070-dentures.md)

# I have those
Combine them (glue to shards, and then the glasses) to have cool 4D glasses.
