Last time you used a crossbow with clock hands soaked in tachyon.

# What now?
You need three items:
 - [The impromptu bow](030-babygoal/050-cello.md)
 - [Clock hands](060-clock.md)
 - [Tachyon (or cheese that is)](030-babygoal/040-cheese.md)

# I have those
Combine all three of them to make the tachyon bow.
