You are back in Elysium just when Goal left. This time you will be telling the story how you hid yourself from the Utopians into the timepod.

The goal of this is to open yourself another portal using the already familiar tools.

# How to open it?
You need:
 - [4D glasses](040-glasses.md)
 - [A clock hand bow](050-bow.md)

# I have these
Great! Quickly, to the bathroom! Use the glasses and activate the portal with the bow.
