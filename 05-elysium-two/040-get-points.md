Well, did you participate in the fun activities?

# I can only get to 9999
Oh, one point short. But the points are memorized in the computer to the next day.

# But I don't have next day!
Oh, right. Maybe you should [get access to the computer first](030-access-computer.md).

# I have access
Right, now. How could the computer remember your already collected points after the time reset?

# I have heard this before...
Yes you have. The way to restore memory between time resets is...

# Tin foil hat!
That's right! Now, [build one](045-tin-foil-hat.md).

# I have the hat
Good, put it on the exposed hard drive in the computer.
