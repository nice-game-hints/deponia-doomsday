Only people with the red _key_ make it to computer core.

# Red key?
The elevator is musical instrument. Maybe you could fool Ronny with your own red key.

# Where to get it?
What musical instrument also has keys in it?

# I dunno
The piano at Goal's habitat. You can borrow one of the keys in it.

# How to get it off
Use a tool, tool.

# Tool?
Take the coal tongs by the fireside and use them on the grand piano. You have a key.

# But it is white
Maybe you could wrap it in some kind of red skin.

# Red skin?
You couldn't do _wurst_.

# I don't get it
There is the Wurst-Things-Wurst machine in the cocktail bar (Chill-out zone). Stick the white key into it. It is now reddish.

# It won't work yet
Yes, Ronny says it has to be more red.

# How?
Maybe heating it up a little would make it more red.

# Heating
There is a heating lamp at the petting zoo heating the chickens. Show the sausage key to the lamp.

# It is red
Indeed. Now you can put it in the empty slot and play it with the mallet. Ohh... how red does it sound.
