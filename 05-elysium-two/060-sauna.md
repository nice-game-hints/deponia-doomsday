You got into the sauna with the elders. Well done, I guess.

# I can't reach anywhere
You are stuck between couple of heavy guys. If you would be a little more slippery.

# Slippery?
Don't you sweat at all?

# No?
Maybe you could get sweat from others.

# Yuck
Touch the beads of sweat both of your sides and then rub your sweaty hands to your torso.

# Uhh... well, now more slippery
You are, and you can reach things.

# Like?
The water ladle? The bracelet?

# And what to do with them?
With water ladle you can take coal. The bracelet can be attached to something.

# What and where?
Attach the bracelet to the grate. Now, if you surprise the Elder Un somehow he might do something.

# Surprise
Like, take the water ladle, pick some coals in it...

# And?
Throw the hot coals into Un's towel.
