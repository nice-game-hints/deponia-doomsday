There are cartridge slots everywhere. The scanner in the computer core will produce cartridges. Look at it.

# DNA?
Yes, you should have some animal parts (like a skin) to put on the scanner.

# Animal skin?
There is the lizard skin at the locks. Try the lizard skin on the scanner.

# I got a cartridge!
Nice. Now you can go and stick it to every slot. That way you find out to see what they do.

# I want more cartridges!
More, you say? Where could you get more animal skins, or patterns?

# Where?
Do you remember Henna and Tanner (at the Habitat ring) having a hard time selecting from their decorations?

# Yes, I do
Maybe you could offer them something else.

# What?
Do you happen to have already [the fine silver gorilla hair](020-elder-un/index.md)?

# I do
Well, it is a excuisite interior decor, don't you think? Offer it to Henna at the Habitat ring.

# Ooh, patterns
They look nice. They probably contain some animal DNA?

# You think?
Go and try all of them in the scanner.

# Scanned!
You should now have three cartridges: one from a lizard, one from a striped sable and one from a... clown. Try them to the slots.
