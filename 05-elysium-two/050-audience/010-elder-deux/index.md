He won't be going anywhere without stroking a striped sable.

# Striped sable?
Yes. You should make a cartridge of that kind of animal for him. [You have the cartridges?](../005-cartridges.md)

# I have the cartridges
The jackalope generator is the machine here. Put two cartridges in it and you can mix the features with each other.

# Cool!
After you have desired animal you can look what it looks like (and get feedback from Deux) by inserting the cartridge into the compartment slot (behind the hatch).

# What kind of animal he wants?
Insert the lizard cartridge and fur mammal cartridge into the jackalope generator.
Build a cartridge that has these features:
 - nice (mood)
 - small (build)
 - fluffy (body hair)
 - sable striped (color)

# It is ready
Good, note that it's extremity does not matter. If you now stick the cartridge into the the slot Deux will pet it and he is ready for the meeting. Just convince the other two.
