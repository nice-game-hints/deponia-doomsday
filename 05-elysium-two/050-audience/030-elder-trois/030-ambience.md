Trois can't enjoy his meal and drinks without a cozy, funny ambience. There is that stage back of the cocktail bar.

# There is
And there is a cartridge slot under it when you open the hatch.

# Okay
Insert one of your cartridges there and see what happens. Your crowd will tell you what they want.

# What do they want?
Inserting different cartridges into the jackalope generator build a cartridge that has these features:
 - funny hat (extremity)
 - funny (mood)
 - colorful (color)

# It is ready
Good, note that it's body type and skin does not matter. If you now stick the cartridge into the the slot under the stage Trois will be satisfied with the athmosphere.
