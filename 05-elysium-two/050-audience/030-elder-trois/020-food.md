Elder Trois complains about the food and displays a (yummy) maggot as an evidence if you just talk with him.

# Maggot, yuck!
Well, not necessarily. You just need to make it look more delicious.

# What, you don't mean?
Aren't sausages fine food?

# Uhh.. well, how then?
There is the Wurst-Things-Wurst machine.

# It doesn't fit
You have to... you know... make it smaller and easier to wurstify.

# Oh my...
Yup. Put the maggot into the blender.

# It is in the blender
Did you push the button? You have to push the button. I know, I know. Just.. please... push the button and get on with it.

# Blended...
Good job! Now put the ground maggot into the wurst machine and give the sausage to Trois.
