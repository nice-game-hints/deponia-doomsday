Elder Un needs some pampering. Why don't you give him a massage?

# My hands are too dainty!
He needs more bigger hands.

# What to do?
There are enormous monster feet slippers at Goal's habitat. Use them.

# I massaged
Now he wants to be waxed.

# Waxed, you say?
We don't have bees here this time. Maybe you could make wax out of something else.

# Like?
In the council floor (pink key) you can find wax plastic balls in the ball pit.

# But, they are balls
But they are plastic, you know.

# What?
Melt them to wax in the red heat lamp. Use the wax to Elder Un and grab the back hair with you.
