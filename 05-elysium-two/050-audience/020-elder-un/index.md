Elder Un really enjoys his massage. Now that the robot has gone wild he needs more massaging to leave his place. Look at his fine silver back hair. Isn't that something.

# I did
But he wants more! Where _are_ the clone servants that replace the robots, by the way?

# Clone servants?
Yes. There was a cloning (and roboting) machine near the computer core. I think that machine sends in the clone servants.

# There was!
Try to insert a cartridge into the slot next to the elevator door, pull the switch (to clone) and go see Un again.

# Un...
There is some kind of monstority next to him. He does not like it and gives you hints what kind of masseur he likes.

# So, what is it?
Inserting different cartridges into the jackalope generator build a cartridge that has these features:
 - nasty (mood)
 - human (build)
 - no scale or fur (body hair)
 - huge paws (exremity)

# It is ready
Good, note that it's body color does not matter. If you now stick the cartridge into the the cloning station slot Un will be enjoying his massage and he is ready for the meeting. Just convince the other two.
