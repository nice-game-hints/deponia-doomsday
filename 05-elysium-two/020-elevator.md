Ronny only let's you to travel to fun zone or locks.

# How to travel more?
Did you notice the counterweight?

# I did
It opens up the selectors. Select from those, musically. Just like Ronny likes it.

# Musically
The counterweight is no good. Maybe if you would have an item designed for playing these kind of things.

# Like?
Like a mallet. You can find one from the locks (on the down alley). Change the counterweight with the mallet and you can control the elevator.
