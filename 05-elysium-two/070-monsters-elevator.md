You are in a time loop, again, starting from Ulysses' shower. This time things are different. There are monsters in the elevator blocking your way.
[There are monsters also later in the elevator.](080-fewlocks.md)

# What to do?
Maybe the elevator terminal would help.

# It has only communication with the elevator
Have you tried fooling it?

# How?
Take Ulysses' helmet and use the helmet on the terminal

# Self-destruct?
Hmm.. maybe later. Are you late, by the way?

# Late of what?
You should hurry. Before the timer in the upper left corner runs out, use the helmet on the terminal. That way you can talk to Goal and convince her not to go.
