Fun Zone:

 - The counterweight makes funny sound (that Ronny does not approve)

 - Jackaloper generator with two cartridge slots
 - Elder Trois (cocktail bar) talks about the computer also


Council of Elders:
 - Lazy Elder Quatre talks about Computer core checkout, maybe that's the key?
 - The heat lamp (from Chill-out Zone) can be switched to the reading lamp

Computer core:
 - Hard drive is in the computer (kick it and take technical stuff away) and the points in the hard drive
 - Cloning machine

Okay, after getting 10000 points

How to scan the animals?

How to fix the computer?

Elder Deux
 - He wants to see the striped sable
  - Striped sable skin was fake
 - Putting different cartridges on the pedestal gives out the requirements
  - fluffy, sable stripes, not too aggressive
  - Use the Jackalope generator to tune one of the cartridges (01, 03) right

Elder Quatre (Council area)
 - He needs tanning, switch the lamp

Elder Trois (Cocktail bar)
 - He wants drinks without fish in them
  - Collect two drinks (other has fish in it) and mix them in the blender
 - He wants acceptable food
  - The maggot is too big to the Wurst-machine
  - Blend it first
 - Now the mood is not right
  - Clone the clown into the stage

Elder Un (Spa, massage)
 - Rufus' hands are too dainty (sirot?)
  - Use the monster feet slippers
 - After massaging he needs hari waxing
  - The plastic (waxy) balls can be melted with the red heating lamp
  - Apply them to back and the take them away
 - Insists on massage: "Where are the clone servants that usually replace robots'
  - So the cloning thing in Computer core will send the massuse automatically
  - Human masseur with powerful hands and no fur or scales

How to get the patterns from Henna?
 - Give her the sample back hair from Elder Un (in the Spa)

What to do with the scanner?
 - Scan animal skins in it and get a cartridge
 - Get more skins, or skin patterns
 - Scan all the patterns. One of them is valid. And you get a clown clone, also.
