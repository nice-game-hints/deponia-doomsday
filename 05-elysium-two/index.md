You are in the best Elysium yet. Having the perfect time. Over and over again. Go have some fun.

At some point you might want to [control the elevator](020-elevator.md).

# I don't know where to go
After you have fixed the elevator, your next place to visit would be the [computer core](030-access-computer.md).

# I got access to the computer, what next?
Now you can finally acquire those [10,000 fun points](040-get-points.md)!

# I got the points, what next?
Now, just [get the audience with the elders](050-audience).
