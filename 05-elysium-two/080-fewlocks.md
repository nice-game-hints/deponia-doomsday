If you are not yet in the locks, check [the other monsters in the elevator hint](070-monsters-elevator.md).
Fewlocks are attacking at the locks. What to do? Both the hotspots are fewlocks!

# Ahem!
Oh, the left hotspot is actually _a button_. So, I just click the button (author's note: I struggled with this. Awful, I know).
