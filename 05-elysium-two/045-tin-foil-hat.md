You are **again** building a tin foil hat. No? The instructions to build it in Deponia are [here](../02-kuvaq/040-tin-foil-hat.md). Forget, for now, that you will be building it again here in Elysium.

# I am in Elysium
Fine, good. So, go ahead. The recipe is the same.

# Same recipe?
Some tinfoil and a straw.

# Where do I find them?
In the council of elders floor (pink note [in the elevator](020-elevator.md)) there is this elder laying in his hammock. He has some tin.

# He does
Exchange his reading lamp with the heating lamp you can find from the chill-out zone. It is heating the chickens.

# He got hot
.. and red, yes. Also he dropped his tin thingy and the grass became... straws.

# Indeed
So, pick up the tin and the straws and combine them in your inventory. Ta-dah! A tin foil hat.
