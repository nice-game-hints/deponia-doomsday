You have talked to Old Maverick, right? He really wants his soup.

# The fewlock soup
Right. [Get some fewlock soup for him.](070-fewlock-soup.md)

# He ate it
Still not happy? He would like to give some hard time to others to have happiness.

# How?
Well, it would be great if he would find a hair in his soup. You can get another soup from young Maverick.

# A hair...
There is Goal's hair brush in the farm house. Use the hair brush in the soup.

# Switch-a-roo!
Well, didn't see that coming. To get the key to his old butter churn talk to young Maverick again.
