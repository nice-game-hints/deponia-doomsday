So, how was Mikey?

# Good
Good, others won't give up so easily. Talk to them.

# Yeah
They are ready to give up their lives for _love_.

# Goal?
Not your love, you silly. Someone _closer_ to them.

# Like?
Like Rita.

# And?
Rokko.

# How do I do this?
First talk to Rita and ask him about Rokko. Then go to Rokko and tell him about Rita. Now you can tell the peanuts about Rita and Rokko.
