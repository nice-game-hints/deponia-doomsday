Rokko can't propose Rita until he has a ring.

# Where to?
Did you talk to Rokko. He said the architect knows where to find these.
[Find the tailcoat first.](140-tailcoat.md)

# I have it
So, you have the tailcoat. But the ring wasn't back there, yet.

# When then?
Didn't the bowling ball have the portal thingy. Maybe there would be a portal still open.

# Where?
At the architect's table. Go and see, there is a portal where you can get the ring.
