Vince, at the diner, would be ready to drive you around. He just needs a detailed map.

# Who draws those maps?
The architect, in the future zone.

# He does not want to
He sees family values in high esteem. Like, getting married and stuff...

# Getting married?
There is a love story brewing between Rokko and Rita. Talk to Rita and then Rokko.

# Tailcoat?
Yes, Rokko would like a tailcoat. The architect knows where (or when) it is.

# Hat fashion, again?
Yeah, go figure. Maybe you should tell him about the latest hat fashions.

# I should know everything about hats now
Except the missing piece? [Get yourself the latest Hats magazine](115-hats-magazine.md) and read the magazine (look it in the inventory). Now you can tell the real latest hat trend.

# Turbans!
Right. Say that to the architect. He gives you the portal map to find the tailcoat.

# I have the map
Show the map to Vince, at the diner. He will take you [there](200-back-there/index.md).
