That crystal ball wasn't there! You should get rid of it.

# How?
Talk to the fortune teller.

# Bad idea
That hasn't stopped you before. Talk to him again and ask about things.

# Like what?
I dunno, hat trends?

# Hat trends!
Yes, ask him about hat trends until he gets to turbans (see, he talks to the architect!).

# Wow!
Yes, so cool! But now he is disturbed by the magazine. Grab the ball.
