The lookout don't let you lower the bridge. He can't have war in two fronts.

# Two fronts?
The other being fewlocks (behind the bridge) and the other wombats attacking their bins.

# Fewlock attack
[Maybe you could make him believe the fewlocks are attacking.](030-distract-lookout.md)

# Alarm!
While the siren is wailing it is your change to cause wombat attack!

[NOTE! There is a known bug with the timer. It should not run out in seconds!](001-timer-bug.md)

# Wombat attack?
The wombats are attacking their bins.

# But how to fake a wombat attack?
There is the battery powered platypus in the farm house. Maybe it would go for wombat.

# How?
Kick the siren in the future zone, walk into the Elysium cluster and put the battery powered platypus into the bin before the timer runs out.

# Wombat attack!
Now he is more concerned about wombats. You can pull the lever to lower the bridge.
