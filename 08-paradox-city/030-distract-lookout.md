That lookout really knows his job. He doesn't let you do anything.

# How to distract him?
Maybe if he would think the fewlocks are coming.

# How?
There is an alarm system in the future.

# In the future?
I mean in the future area. Right and down from the city center. Kick the siren. You have until the clock ticks out to do your thing at the Elysium cluster.

[NOTE! There is a known bug with the timer. It should not run out in seconds!](001-timer-bug.md)
