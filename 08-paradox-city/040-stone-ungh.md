Ungh appreciates stones and is ready to trade for them.

# Stone...
Did you visit the farm house?

# Yes
Goal has created great art there.

# Sculptures, yes
Made out of stone?

# Stone!
STONE-NOT-READY! NEEDS-MORE-TIME-TO-WORK-WITH!

# What?
Ungh won't take it as it is not ready.

# How to finish it?
With time, my friend, with time.

# I... don't...
Throw the sculpture into the drill hole in the future zone. You get a nice boulder to give to Ungh.
