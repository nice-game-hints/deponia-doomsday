Rokko can't propose Rita until he has a tailcoat.

# Where to?
Did you talk to Rokko. He said the architect knows where to find these.

# The architect
He is in the future zone. Talk to him.

# Hat fashion, again?
Yeah, go figure. Maybe you should tell him about the latest hat fashions.

# I should know everything about hats now
Except the missing piece? [Get yourself the latest Hats magazine](115-hats-magazine.md) and read the magazine (look it in the inventory). Now you can tell the real latest hat trend.

# Turbans!
Right. Say that to the architect. He gives you the portal map to find the tailcoat.

# Map?
There was someone in the diner ready to help you.

# Vince!
Right! Show the map to Vince, at the diner. He will take you [there](200-back-there/index.md).
