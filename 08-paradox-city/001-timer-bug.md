In the future area (the drill and the siren) if you kick the siren it should **every time** give you the same time to act. In some cases the timer goes off in couple of seconds. There is a workaround:
 - Click the siren, Rufus starts to walk there
 - Put your mouse ready on the exit (up and left corner)
 - When Rufus kicks the siren just click multiple times so that Rufus exits immediately
 - In the next screen (main square) keep clicking really fast on some exit and then really fast back to the main square
 - Keep doing these quick exits before the time runs out
 - The timer should fix itself after couple of attempts
