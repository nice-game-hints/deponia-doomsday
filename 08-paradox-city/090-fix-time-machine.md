It is missing one cylinder. Or butter churn.

# Which?
Well, the butter churn (you found it from the farm yard) is broken.

# How to fix it?
Did you know Rokko is running a _workshop_?

# True
Take the butter churn to Rokko. He will fix it.

# Cylinder head!
No it is not! It is your new [butter churn](100-peanut-butter.md)!
