# Instructions
There is a butter churn at the farmyard.

# But it is broken!
[Fix it](092-butter-churn.md)

# I have... it
You have the new butter churn. Deal with it.

# So?
Add the milk and the peanuts into the cylinder... I mean butter churn.

# They are there
Then, churn.

# How?
[Did you get keys to the Maverick's time machine, already?](080-time-machine-key.md)

# Yes
Start the time machine and the hood pops. Open the hood. As you can see the motor is missing one cylinder head.

# So?
Insert the cylinder head, with milk and peanuts, into the motor.

Peanuts, it was nice to know you.
