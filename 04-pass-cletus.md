title: How to pass Cletus?
---

So, you set the poisonous creature free and now you should get past Cletus undetected.

# That is right
There is a laser pointer in the creature's luggage. Grab it.

# Okay
From the back position (among the luggages, that is), point the laser pointer to the pipe. You get a skippable minigame.

# Aha!
Now Cletus is in better position to steal his ID card. Go to the pipe (just click it) and steal the ID. Did you push the call button?

# Yes, but
It makes too much noise and Cletus spots it.

# Noise?
Maybe you could make some noise to the tubes. Wasn't McCormick down there? Talk to him.

# He is
Now, he is in the tubes and poisoned by the creature.

# Maybe I should help him
Good idea! Give him the antidote. Now the tubes are filled with... umm.. noises.

# Noice!
Please, don't. Okay, go up and push the call button. The slot is open now. Insert Cletus' ID card into the slot.
