The students won't let you out of the lecture hall.

# Those brats!
Maybe give them something to look at.

# Like what?
What is that thing on the table?

# An experiment
Activate it, then.

# How?
There is the running wheel, there is the platypus.

# And?
Take the platypus basket, open the grate, take the platypus into the basket and the put the platypus into the running wheel. You just created a small anonmaly.
