Can't leave without giving them something to do

How to get out?
The students don't let you out.
Take the test platypus into the basket and put the platypus into the running wheel.
Anomaly appears and they are occupied with it now.

Show the note to students, query for "Romantic Ninja". You get a fresh sandwich, lunch.

How to motivate the platypus? Catch another platypus and show it to him.

To stop it stick the umbrella in to the wheel.


Outside:

Can't make it into the Admin office:
Not until the bell has rung.

Lab door is locked.


The ill-sighted lad can't hit the pi√±ata.

The switch (front) switches which flag pole is up


Tower:
Create a platypus trap on the scaffold. Trap being the platypus basket with a bait in it.

Platypus does not eat fresh sandwich. To make it old, stick it into the anomaly.

Capture the platypus by putting the old sandwich in to the basket and the basket on to the scaffolding.

Admin office:
Take the bird warning sign away and you get shards of glass.
