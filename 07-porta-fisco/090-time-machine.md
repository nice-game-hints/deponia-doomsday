So, you found yourself [into the lab](070-lab.md). You need some help with it. Look at the time machine and then go to lecture hall. The students will help you.

# I need...
You need:
 - [4D glasses](100-4d-glasses.md)
 - [Something that emits tachyons (feta cheese?)](120-goat.md)

# I have them
Now, in the lab. Use the 4D glasses. The portal appears.

# Neat
After the portal is visible insert the feta cheese into the tachyon tank.

# And then?
Pump the tank multiple of times.
