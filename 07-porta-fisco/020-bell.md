Dean won't accept your visit until the bell rings.

# Time is not moving
Your lecture is so boring? Maybe you could make the time go faster.

# How?
You have the [_small_ anomaly going on](010-getout.md), right?

# Yes
Make it bigger.

# How?
You just need to make the platypus more motivated.

# Again, how?
Show it another platypus. There is an albino platypus in the tower. [Catch it](030-catch-platypus.md)

# I have albino platypus
Nice. Now, just put the platypus basket on the table. The other platypus will go wild.

# Time to go
The larger anomaly indeed makes time fly and the bell rings!
