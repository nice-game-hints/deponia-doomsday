I take that you have found your [way into the lab](070-lab.md), already.
You want to build authentic 4D glasses? Why not!

# How?
To build the 4D glasses you need:
 - [Glass frames](110-glasses.md)
 - [Shards of glass](105-shards.md)

# I have both
Combine them.

# They don't stick on their own
Maybe some chewing gum. You find some chewing gum from the lecture hall. Under the chair.

# The chewing gum does not help
Yeah, that would've been unrealistic. Who else would enjoy the gum?

# Dean?
Nicotine gum that is. Put the gum into the ashtray. It becomes nicotine chewing gum. Give it to Dean.

# Glue!
Yes, take the glue and glue the glasses together.
