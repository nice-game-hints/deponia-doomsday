You want to catch that rare albino platypus from the tower?

# Yes
First, you need a trap. The platypus basket will suffice. You can put it on the scaffold.

# It doesn't go there
Well, you need a bait.

# Where to get it?
Did you check the bulletin board outside. It is next to admin office.

# I got a note
About sharing a lunch? You should find the "Romantic Ninja".

# Who is he?
Go to the lecture hall and use the note on the students. You get a nice fresh sandwich. That is your bait.

# The platypus won't like it
The sandwich should be older. But you don't have time to wait.

# Anomaly!
Right! Stick the sandwich into the small anomaly. It will get older, just like platypuses like it.

# Bait ready
Put the bait into the platypus basket and put the basket on the scaffold. That's how you trap a platypus.
