You should catch that goat. Then you can milk it!

# Really?
That goat is jumping from pole to pole if you use the switch next to the bulletin board.

# How to get it down?
Maybe if it would slip?

# From?
From an oil puddle, for example. 

# How to do it?
Do you see where the gutter in the tower ends?

# Interesting spot
Go pour some oil to the gutter in the tower. You can find oil from the bronze tap [in the lab](070-lab.md).

# Where to collect it?
Collect the oil into the blackboard bin you find from the lecture hall. Pour the oil into the gutter (in the tower).

# Slippery
Now, pull the switch until the goat turns into a pi√±ata. You can go and milk it now for feta cheese.
