Dean does not let you do anything. You should give him something else to do.

# Like?
Did you look at his table?

# The ashtray?
Yup. He was a smoker.

# Maybe...
Take the pipe from the wall and give it to Dean.

# No tobacco
Oh, there's some weed outside you can use. Combine the weed with the pipe and give it to Dean.
